# Games AI enrichment assistant

Propose-only AI for the member **Games** catalog editor (`members.html`). Editors review suggestions and apply selected fields; nothing auto-writes without an explicit apply.

## Delivery status (done)

- [x] Edge Function `ai-game-enrich-propose` (JWT, `games_editor` / `games_admin` / `club_admin`, audit `ai_proposal`)
- [x] Description proposals: structured fields, existing `details`, OPDB/Pinside/IPDB **research snippets** (HTML fetch where possible), length guard (~220–320 chars), manufacturer + year in prose when metadata supports it, trim labels like `(Pro)` / `(LE)` in generated copy
- [x] Link proposals: IPDB search fallback; **Pinside** and **Kineticist** canonical-style URLs from `slug` + title + release year when derivable
- [x] Portal: `SNHMemberPortal.aiGameEnrichPropose`, proposal UI with checkboxes, external link validation, **AI block under core game fields, above stints**
- [x] Combobox filter **Only at club today** (effective at-club: manual override, then map, then `atClub`)
- [x] Editor UX: collapsible `<details>` sections (location stints, for sale, owner link, high scores, mods, Pingolf) **collapsed by default**; Save/Cancel remain at bottom of form
- [x] Supporting docs: style guide, fixtures notes, rollback runbook, contract script under `scripts/`

## Not in scope yet (ideas)

- [ ] Optional external-image caching/derivative pipeline after reuse and hotlink policy is established; see `docs/game-images.md`
- [ ] Structured field proposals (type, display, player count) from AI
- [ ] Fixture-driven automated tests for every resolver edge case (see `games-ai-fixtures.md`)

## Operator setup

1. **Deploy function** (after code or secret changes):  
   `supabase functions deploy ai-game-enrich-propose`

2. **Secrets** (Supabase project → Edge Functions secrets):
   - `OPENAI_PLATFORM_KEY` or `LLM_API_KEY` (chat completions)
   - Optional: `LLM_PRIMARY_MODEL`, `LLM_SECONDARY_MODEL`

3. **Config**: `supabase/config.toml` sets `verify_jwt = true` for this function.

## Editor workflow (short)

1. Open a game → **Attempt Metadata Enhancement** or **Attempt Description Update**.
2. Review fields; use **Open in new tab** links to validate URLs.
3. **Apply selected fields** only for rows you trust. Manage all images in the separate **Images** section through club uploads and deterministic OPDB sync.
4. Rollback mistakes: `docs/games-ai-rollback-runbook.md`.
